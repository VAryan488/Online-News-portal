# Online-News-portal
The Online News Portal is a basic web-based news website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a digital platform for displaying news articles across various categories such as World, Technology, and Sports. The portal provides users with a clean interface to browse and filter news based on their interests. 
This project simulates the front end of a real news website, demonstrating how static content can be organized, styled, and made interactive using only client-side technologies.

🧰 Technologies Used:
HTML5 – to structure the web content

CSS3 – to style the layout, fonts, and colors

JavaScript – to add interactivity, such as category-based filtering

💡 Key Features:
🗂️ Category Filter Buttons: Users can filter news articles by clicking "World", "Technology", or "Sports".

📰 Responsive News Layout: Articles are presented with headings, descriptions, and optional images.

🎨 Stylish and Clean UI: A user-friendly interface with a modern look.

🧱 Modular Structure: Organized file structure with external CSS and JS files.

🧱 Folder Structure:

✅ How It Works:
Homepage loads with all news articles visible.

The navigation buttons allow users to filter articles by category.

JavaScript hides or displays news blocks based on the selected category.

Images enhance visual content and can be local or from placeholder sources.

📈 Future Improvements (Optional Enhancements):
Fetch live news using the News API

Add a search bar for keyword-based filtering

Make the site responsive for mobile devices

Add a backend (PHP/Node.js) to manage and store articles

Integrate user login for personalization
